# python_and_datascience
Based on the book Data Science from Scratch

Initial idea is to have one python file per chapter. Comments are left in to allow me to go back and review what I did.

All files within the `code` folder are taken directly from the repo `joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch`

### Introduction

* uses `introduction.py`

### Test code and helpful funtions to develop

* uses `tests.py`
